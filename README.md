# NodeJS - Final Project (Full-Stack Application)

**Goal:** Create a full-stack CRUD application of your choosing using NodeJS, Express, and Socket.io with Postgres or MongoDB as the database.

## Requirements ✅

- **Backend:** You need to use NodeJS and Express with MVC design architecture. Create routes for your CRUD functionality.
- **Database:** Data needs to be stored inside a database of your choosing. Use an ORM such as `Prisma` or `Mongoose`.
- **Security:** Your application needs to have user registration and login authentication. Make sure to integrate `bcrypt` for hashing and `cookies` or `jsonwebtoken` for increased security by implementing middleware so that only logged-in users can send a request.
- **Frontend:** You can choose whichever frontend (Astro, EJS, React, NextJS, etc.). The website needs to be responsive.
- **WebSockets:** Integrate Socket.io into your application in some way.
- **TypeScript:** Always!

## Some Ideas 💡

- Multi-user chat app with rooms and you can also send messages directly to another user *(similar to Slack)*
- Document real-time collaboration *(similar to Google Docs)*
- 2D-based multiplayer game where you can see players move in real time.
- Real-time data fetching and display *(stock market graph tracker)*

## Instructions 📖

1. Set up your GitHub Project and decide as a team what application you are going to build.
2. Decide your tech stack and assign roles and tasks for each member. Plan a timeline of when something needs to be done.
3. Design your application in Figma. Do not overcomplicate the design and try to create something that you can build in a few days.
4. Once you are done with the development, create a pull request to your main branch and merge.

*Good luck! 🙌*
